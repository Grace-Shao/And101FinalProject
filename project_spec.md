## App Overview

### Description 

**This app will allow you to adopt any Pokemon from the Pokemon API and add it to your roster in a seperate location and you may have them as buddies on your team.**

### App Evaluation

Mobile: Pokémon has always been synonymous with portability, making it inherently mobile-friendly. With features like location-based adoption centers or AR integration for catching Pokémon in real-world environments, the app could offer a uniquely mobile experience.

Story: The story around the app could be compelling, especially if it incorporates elements of friendship, exploration, and care for Pokémon. Players could embark on quests to rescue abandoned Pokémon, nurture them back to health, and find them new homes, creating an emotional connection and sense of purpose.

Value: The value proposition is clear to Pokémon fans who desire to engage with their favorite creatures in a more meaningful way beyond battles. It offers the chance to simulate the experience of being a Pokémon Trainer and emphasizes the importance of compassion and responsibility.

Market: The market for Pokémon-related content is massive, encompassing fans of all ages worldwide. However, the uniqueness lies in the focus on adoption and nurturing rather than battling, catering to a segment of the market interested in the emotional aspect of Pokémon ownership.

Habit: The app's habit-forming potential is high, especially if it incorporates daily tasks like feeding, grooming, and training Pokémon. Regular updates with new Pokémon to adopt or events to participate in could keep users engaged over the long term.

Scope: While technically challenging to implement features like AR integration or a robust adoption system, a stripped-down version focusing on basic adoption mechanics could still be interesting and valuable. The key lies in balancing features with development time and resources.
